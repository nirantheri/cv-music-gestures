notes

using scikit learn for test train split

Kalman filter for smooth detection
mediapipe
PyTorch or Tensorflow
soundfile, pyfluidsynth, and PyAudio

numpy
opencv

pykalman--> built in kalman filter

unzip the file
both of us will look at the demo.py in hagrid dataset

look at mediapipe and also models and how to create them pytorch

eventually create a virtual environment we can both use

practicing pulling images / folders from the dataset using testing.ipynb

setting up a lightweight model?

Model architecture to use
-- lightweight with limited layers
-- taking yolov8
-- R-CNN/Mask R-CNN
